### Java EPAM Lab

This repository contains a project written in the EPAM SYSTEMS laboratory in the winter and spring of 2020 as a training assignment.

The project is a web-based news management application. The application implements the ability to add, view, edit and delete news, add and remove author and news tags.

The application consists of two parts: a frontend server written in JavaScript using NodeJS, React and AJAX ("news-client" folder), and a backend server written in Java using Spring Framework and Hibernate ("news-manager" folder). The project uses the PostgeSQL database, tests using JUnit 4, and logging with Log4j.
